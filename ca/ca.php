Campus ambassadors act as the face of one of the biggest techno-management festival in the entire North-East India and are entrusted with the job of increasing the outreach of the fest through on field and social media publicity. The campus ambassadors are entitled to exciting prizes, apart from the coveted certificate and many other goodies.

                <blockquote> Hello IITP, I remember I went to Celesta when I was in the first year of my college. I was scared but yeah that experience pulled me again and again and Celesta 2K18 was my third year in a row. And this year was damn amazing...The environment was spellbinding. And yeah, I really enjoyed working and sharing the notifications of Celesta 2k18. In between of those times sometimes I started feeling like I am the part of the Team and yeah, it was great being a part of such great environment and such enthusiastic people.. Celesta is not just a college fest, it feels like it's a Festival that comes every year and we all celebrate it together.. ðŸ–¤ <br>-<b>Mridul Choudhary</b> </blockquote>

I not only enjoyed being working as the campus ambassador, but also enjoyed your fest. The participants from my college were also very happy by your organisation. Hope to continue to work with you all more as I gained a good experience. Thank you for selecting me as the campus ambassador of my college. <br>-<b>Kamal Kant</b> </blockquote>
